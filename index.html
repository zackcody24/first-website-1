    <h1>What tactics are car dealerships using to take advantage of me?</h1>
      <h2>Advertising low/no down payments</h2>
        <p>Often, dealerships will advertise that they have the ability to get customers with challenged credit situations approved on vehicles. However, once the customer arrives, the story is quite different. Dealers will tell you whatever you want to hear just to get you in their doors. They will then tell you that you need more money down and that you could not qualify to get the low down payment advertised (all in hopes that you actually have money saved up, or will save up money and come back</p>
      <h2>Promoting "HUGE" Sales Events</h2>
        <p>You can almost always find a dealership promoting some sort of "big sale" or "huge sales event". However, these are almost always just another mirage to get you to visit the dealership! There is almost never a real sale going on. The dealership will just manipulate the numbers to make it appear that there is a sale.</p>
      <h2>Doubling your down payment</h2>
        <p>Another classic trick is for the dealership to advertise that they will double your down payment. This one is simple. All the dealership does is mark the price of their vehicles up. For example: Mr. Johnson comes in hoping to buy a car that costs $10,000 and he wants to double his down payment of $1000 (making it so that he puts down $2000 on the $10,0000 car. What the customer does not know is that a week prior, the dealership had marked the price of the vehicle up from $7,000 to $10,000. Now, the customer is financing $8,000 but does not know that the price of the car has been increased beforehand, and the dealership actually makes $1,000 more on the vehicle even though they "doubled the down payment"</p>
      <h2>Offering $x MORE for for your trade in value</h2>
        <p>This one is very similar to the "double your down payment" scam. Dealerships will simply raise the price of their vehicle to compensate for however much money they are giving you extra on your trade. For example, dealers will often advertise a sale of "1500 more for your trade!" All they are doing is raising the price of their cars by $1500 to make up for the difference</p>
      <h2>Not giving you the money your trade in is worth</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, dealers will severely undercut customers on trade in values. It is very important to know what your vehicle is worth. To get a good idea of your vehicles value, check out <a href="https://www.nada.com" target="blank"> NADA TRADE IN VALUES </a></p>
      <h2>Internet team lying to you just to get you to visit</h2>
        <p>Beware! As soon as a dealership aqquires your info, you will most likely get a call or text from someone on the internet team or BDC (Business Development Center). The internet team's job is solely to set appointments. At whatever cost. The information you are given will often be misleading just to get you to come visit the dealership, as the internet team is only paid based on appointments.</p>
      <h2>Raising your interest rate</h2>
        <p>Whenever dealerships are contracting a deal with a bank or lender, they are offered what is called a "buy rate" by the lender. This is the interest rate at which the dealership buys the contract. Dealers are then free to raise this interest rate a few points when they sell you the car. This is called the "sell rate". Typically, only customers that do not have good credit will have to worry about this one because customers with perfect credit already expect the interest rate to be as close to 0% as possible.</p>
      <h2>Lying about money down</h2>
        <p>When dealerships have a customer that they can tell is not financially informed, they will sometimes attempt to tell the customer they HAVE to have some money down in order to get a vehicle. Sometimes, this is not true at all. Sometimes, dealers will just use this as another way to try to get more money out of the customer's pocket.</p>

  <h1>Why should I be informed?</h1>
      <p>It is important to do your homework and have a gameplan before visting a dealership because they most certainly have a gameplan for when you arrive, and while it may come across as if this game plan is to provide you with the best solution possible, it is most likely that the gameplan is to sell you a car (whether it results in the best solution for you or not).</p>

<div class="about-me">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 22 year old car salesman at the time this website is being constructed. I decided to take a chance at selling cars after I obtained my Associate's Degree in 2018. I started selling cars because I read online about how easy it was to make good money and how you didn't have to have a Bachelor's degree. That really stood out to me because I did not enjoy my college classes at all. 
          <br>
          <br> Not long after I began selling cars, I realized that there is a lot of manipulation going on in the business. Shortly after that, I realized that there are several ways that dealerships will use sly advertising, tricky wordplay, dishonesty, and much more to take advantage of the customer all in hopes of resulting in a car deal. I gradually became more and more uncomfortable with the requirements that fell upon me. Eventually, I decided I no longer wanted to sell cars. 
          <br>
          <br>After several weeks of analyzing my personal skillset, research, and a lot of thinking, I determined that I would really enjoy becoming a software engineer (web developer). I decided that I wanted my first website to be a website that sheds light on all the ways I am aware of that dealerships will take advantage of a customer. 
          <br>
          <br>PLEASE NOTE that I am aware that not every car dealership in the world is soley out to make money and that there are some dealerships out there who truly do have the customer's best interest in mind. However, the majority of dealerships do not truly care about the customer and I am here to expose them.
